# About Me

I’m a software developer specialized in **backend development**, with solid experience in **frontend** and **databases**.

I’m genuinely interested in understanding how systems work end to end, and I enjoy focusing on **software architecture**, **clean code**, and applying **SOLID principles** to build scalable, maintainable solutions.
